# RaspberryPiImaging
This is a Bash script for imaging Raspberry Pi SD cards

The script is run as a cronjob every minute to check and see if a device is connected. If the device is connected then it will apply the image to it.

To use this you will need to change the names of files and change partition/device names to match what you are using.
